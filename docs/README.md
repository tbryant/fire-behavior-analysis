# Fire Analysis Visualization

This GitHub Pages site hosts interactive fire behavior analysis maps using LANDFIRE data.

## Interactive Map

View the [Fire Behavior Map](index.html) to explore:
- Fire spread rates
- Flame lengths
- Crown fire potential
- Fuel characteristics

The map uses real LANDFIRE data and calculates fire behavior using the Rothermel fire spread model.

**Current Example**: Healdsburg, California area

## Data Sources

- **LANDFIRE**: Landscape fire and resource management planning tools database
- **Analysis**: Fire behavior calculations based on crown fire initiation and spread models

## About

This analysis was generated using fire behavior modeling scripts available in the main repository.
